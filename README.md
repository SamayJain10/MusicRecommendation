# MusicRecommendation
The popularity of online music streaming services has created an enormous need for personalized music recommendation systems. The aim of this project is to develop a music recommendation system using machine learning models and Python.

The models used in this study are collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid filtering models. Collaborative filtering model recommends music to users based on the listening history and preferences of similar users, while content-based filtering recommends music based on the attributes of the songs that the user has previously listened to.

The hybrid filtering model combines both collaborative and content-based filtering to provide better recommendations. The accuracy of these models was evaluated using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The results showed that the hybrid filtering model provided the best music recommendations with an accuracy of over 80%.

The music recommendation system developed in this study can be integrated into any music streaming service to provide personalized music recommendations to users.
